(*Coming soon ...*)

I started blogging with github.io to record/manage progress on my studies and works. I started with a very popular theme [mininmal-mistake](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes). More than 7.8k users starred this theme.



## How to

### Clone Minimal mistake

- The first step is cloning the theme to your GitHub folder in your PC.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git
```

- Change the folder name **minimal-mistake** to **[username].github.io**. In my case, folder name is set as **acousticwave.github.io**.



### Hosting your blog

- You need to build a repository to host your blog (the folder **acousticwave.github.io**). A new repository can be created on GitHub webpage. Repository name is set as **acousticwave.github.io**.
