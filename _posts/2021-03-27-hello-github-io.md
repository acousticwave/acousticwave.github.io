I started blogging with github.io to record/manage progress on my studies and works.

I started with a very popular theme [mininmal-mistake](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes). More than 7.8k users starred this theme.



## How to

- The first step is cloning the theme 
- You ca
- Make a "_posts" folder
